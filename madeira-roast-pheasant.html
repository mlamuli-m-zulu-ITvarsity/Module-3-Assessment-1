                    <h2>Steps</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Melt 25g/1oz of the butter in a large roasting tin. Stir in the onion,
                        celery, carrots, bay leaves and half of the mixed herbs. Top with the
                        pheasant giblets and necks, and the chicken wings and breasts. Roast in
                        the oven for about 40 minutes until well browned, turning frequently.</li>
                        <li>Pat the pheasant dry inside and out. Loosen the breast skin on each by
                            gently sliding your fingers under the neck flap and down between the
                            breast meat and skin, being careful not to tear the skin. Spread the herb
                            butter evenly over the breast. Sprinkle each cavity with salt and pepper.
                            Put 2 tablespoons herb butter into each cavity. Truss the pheasants to
                            hold their shape. Arrange on their sides on top of the vegetable mixture.</li>
                        <li>Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, basting frequently with the pan juices.
                            Turn over and roast for a further 15 minutes, basting frequently.</li>    
                        <li>Add the stock to the roasting tin. Boil for about 6 minutes until reduced
                            to 600ml/1pt liquid, scraping up any browned bits. Melt the remaining
                            butter in a small heavy pan over a low heat. Add the flour and stir for
                            3 minutes. Whisk in the sauce in a thin stream. Simmer for 5 minutes,
                            stirring frequently.</li>
